# About Me

Hey, I’m Matt Grilli.

I like building systems that make sense—things that help people stay aligned, stay organized, and stay out of unnecessary chaos.

## Snapshot

- **Started Old School:** Visual Basic, AOL progz, and that early spark for tinkering.
  
- **Game Dev Curiosity:** Wrote some C# scripts for a custom Ultima Online server. Still think about how fun that was.

- **Web Stack Leaning:** Python, Flask, and JavaScript got me hooked on web development.

- **Current Focus:** Working with Next.js and TypeScript, learning more as I go. Trying to build things that are a little more thoughtful than flashy.

I’m not trying to be an expert—just aiming to make useful things, keep learning, and do the work in a way that holds up over time.
