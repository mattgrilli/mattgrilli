# About Me

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Matt Grilli, a passionate programmer with a diverse background in software development.

## Background

- **Early Days**: My journey in programming began with Visual Basic and tinkering with AOL progz. I was fascinated by the possibilities of creating software and pushing the boundaries of what was possible.
  
- **C# Scripting**: I delved deeper into programming through C# scripting for my private Ultima Online Server. It was my playground for experimenting with game mechanics and scripting logic.

- **Web Development**: My interests shifted towards web development, where I found myself exploring the dynamic world of Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Building web applications became my new passion as I embraced the versatility and interactivity the web offers.

- **Next JS with TypeScript**: Currently, I'm diving into Next JS with TypeScript, combining the power of React with the reliability and scalability of TypeScript. It's an exciting journey, and I'm constantly learning and expanding my skills.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸš€
